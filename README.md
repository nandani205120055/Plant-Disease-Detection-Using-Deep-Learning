# Plant-Disease-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning

This project aimed to develop a plant disease detection system using deep learning models and the PlantVillage dataset.

Three models, namely CNN, AlexNet, and ResNet34, were implemented and evaluated.

Through extensive training and evaluation, ResNet34 emerged as the most accurate model, achieving a remarkable validation accuracy of 99.3%.

The success of the ResNet34 model can be attributed to its deeper architecture and the inclusion of residual connections, which enable it to effectively capture intricate patterns and features in plant images. The exceptional accuracy of 99.3% demonstrates the model's capability to accurately classify diseased and healthy plant samples.

Languages: Python
